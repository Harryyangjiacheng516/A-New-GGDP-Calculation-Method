# A-New-GGDP-Calculation-Method

  Expanding climate crisis, lightning-speed growth in pollution, rising risk of global warming–
all of these trends suggest that environmental sustainability should become the primary goal for
any human activity in the future. In order to better reflect the performance of each country in
terms of its climate and environmental status, economists proposed a new way to calculate the
Gross Domestic Product (GDP)–Green GDP (GGDP), which takes environmental factors into
consideration. In our research, we analyzed and evaluated the GGDP method, and proposed a
possible solution for countries to adopt.

  Firstly, our team examined different GGDP calculation methods and selected the most
comprehensive and universal GGDP formula for further study. By observing the formula, we
realized that there might be a relationship between GDP and each environmental factor. In
order to understand their relationships, our team constructed a Polynomial Regression Model
(PRM). To verify our model is valid, we found the data from ten countries in the past twenty
years, and by using RStudio, we found that each environmental factor affects GDP in different
ways, and the change from GDP to GGDP has a much less impact on developed countries than
on developing countries.

  We then studied how each factor affects the GDP and GGDP. We then noticed that not
all environmental factors are not specifically relevant to climate mitigation, so we believe an
adjusted GGDP formula would be able to more accurately reflect the impact on climate. From
our PRM model, we learned that CO2 emission is a more important factor in climate, while solid
waste might be less relevant to climate change. Therefore, we adjust the original GGDP formula
by assigning different weights to these factors. Also, by considering the difference between
developed and developing countries, we take different possible policies into consideration.
To achieve this goal, we constructed a three-layer Adjusted Climate-Focused GGDP Model
(ACF) by using Analytic Hierarchy Process- Entropy weight method (AHP-EWM) Analysis.

  The result suggested that developing countries are in general more negatively affected by the
change from GDP to GGDP, but they can achieve an optimal GGDP when they adopt moderate
environmental and climate policies, i.e. prioritize both climate mitigation and economic growth.
On the other hand, developed countries do not need to change their policies, because they were
barely affected by the change from GDP to GGDP.

  In the end, we applied our findings from both models to China and compared the estimated
GGDP with its actual GDP from 2001 to 2020. Our team found that the result of our model
matched the actual GDP growth trend and growth rate of China, and we attempted to explain
our findings.
